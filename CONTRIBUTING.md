### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are usually smaller, well-defined tasks suitable for getting started.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-acmoj.git` *(Replace with your fork link)*
3.  **Create a branch** for your local development: `git checkout -b my-new-feature` or `git checkout -b fix/bug-name`. Use a descriptive branch name.
4.  **Make your changes** locally.
5.  **Test your changes** thoroughly (see [Testing](#testing)).
6.  **Commit your changes** using a clear and descriptive commit message. Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g., `feat: Add problemset filtering`, `fix: Correct equation rendering`).
7.  **Push your branch** to your fork: `git push origin my-new-feature`.
8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork's branch to the `main` (or `master`) branch of the original repository.
9.  **Provide a clear description** of your PR, explaining the changes and linking to the relevant issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).
10. Be prepared to **discuss your changes** and make adjustments based on feedback.

## Development Setup

To get the extension running locally for development:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, e.g., >= 18.x)
    *   `npm` (comes with Node.js) or `yarn`
    *   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (latest stable version recommended)
2.  **Clone your fork:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-acmoj.git`
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd vscode-acmoj`
4.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install`
5.  **Open the project in VS Code:** `code .`
6.  **Compile TypeScript (optional, happens automatically on debug):** `npm run compile` or `npm run watch` for continuous compilation.
7.  **Start Debugging:** Press `F5` or go to the "Run and Debug" view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and click the green play button for "Run Extension". This will:
    *   Compile the TypeScript code (if needed).
    *   Open a new VS Code window (the **Extension Development Host**) with your extension loaded and running.

You can now use the extension in the Extension Development Host window and set breakpoints, inspect variables, etc., in the original VS Code window where you launched the debugger.

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the key files and directories:

```
.
├── .vscode/             # VS Code specific settings (launch.json, tasks.json)
├── node_modules/        # Project dependencies (including katex)
├── out/                 # Compiled JavaScript output (from src/)
├── src/                 # TypeScript source code
│   ├── extension.ts     # Main activation/deactivation point
│   ├── api.ts           # Client for interacting with the ACMOJ API
│   ├── auth.ts          # Handles Personal Access Token storage and validation

├── CONTRIBUTING.md      # This file!
├── package.json         # Extension manifest (metadata, dependencies, contributions, activation)
├── README.md            # Extension documentation for users
└── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript compiler configuration
```

*   **`package.json`** is crucial. It defines how the extension integrates with VS Code (commands, views, configuration, activation events).
*   **`src/extension.ts`** is the entry point where services are initialized and features are registered.
*   Most user-facing features involve registering a **command** (`src/commands.ts`), potentially interacting with the **API** (`src/api.ts`), managing **authentication** (`src/auth.ts`), and displaying information in **views** (`src/views/`) or **webviews** (`src/webviews.ts`).

## Coding Style

*   **Language:** TypeScript. Please follow standard TypeScript best practices.
*   **Linter/Formatter:** We use ESLint and potentially Prettier (check `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js`). Please run `npm run lint` and/or `npm run format` before committing. Ensure your editor is configured to use these tools.
*   **VS Code API:**
    *   Use the official `vscode` API module.
    *   Properly manage disposables by adding them to `context.subscriptions` in `activate` or managing them within specific components (like WebviewPanels).
    *   Use asynchronous operations (`async`/`await`) appropriately, especially for API calls and VS Code UI interactions that return `Thenable`.
*   **Error Handling:** Use `try...catch` for operations that might fail (like API calls). Provide informative error messages to the user using `vscode.window.showErrorMessage`. Log detailed errors to the console for debugging (`console.error`).
*   **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections. Use TSDoc comments for exported functions and classes.

## Testing

Currently, testing is primarily done **manually** using the Extension Development Host (`F5`):

1.  Launch the extension via `F5`.
2.  In the new window:
    *   Test the login/logout flow (`Set Personal Access Token`, `Clear Personal Access Token`).
    *   Verify the status bar updates correctly.
    *   Test refreshing and navigating the Problemset and Submission views.
    *   Test opening problem details (check Markdown and KaTeX rendering).
    *   Test opening submission details.
    *   Test submitting code from the editor or problem view.
    *   Test aborting submissions (if applicable).
    *   Test edge cases (invalid token, API errors, empty lists, invalid problem IDs).

*   **Unit/Integration Tests:** If tests are added using `@vscode/test-electron`, they can be run via `npm test`. Please add tests for new features or bug fixes where appropriate.
